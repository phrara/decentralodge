# decentralodge
A decentralized storage network based on Golang
<br>
This project will consider the function of IPFS and adopt one of its cores,a P2P go-library called 
*<u>libp2p</u>*.This wonderful library will be the fundamental part of our project,however,writer's
capability is quite poor,so the usage of the lib seem stupid and unfamiliar.
<br>
***
The progress of the project would be slow,writer sincerely hope it could
make great progress one day.
